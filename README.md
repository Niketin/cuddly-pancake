# cuddly-pancake
This is my implementation of the 
Pre-assignment for junior developer positions
https://www.reaktor.com/junior-dev-assignment/

The program uses the status file that is given as the first argument or by default /var/lib/dpkg/status.

Custom port number can be given as an environmental variable "PORT" for example PORT=8080.

# deployed webserver
The server should be automatically deployed to Heroku in case of accepted pull request to master.

Here is the link to the server
